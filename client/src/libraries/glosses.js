Abbreviation could be done by writing only the first letter or first few letters of a word, or by omitting word endings. One example is "και compendium" (ϗ) where a kappa with a trailing flourish stands for και. When the shortening is done by omitting the middle letters it is called a contraction (see below).',

    long: 'The script deriving from the common letter forms of antiquity, used in most Greek books until the 9th century, when it was largely replaced by minuscule. It was used after that in headings (lemmata) within minuscule manuscripts and in liturgical manuscripts. The letters were unconnected, and all of the same hight. No word division was used.'

  'Miniscule needs new def': {
    short: 'A writing style characterized by rounded, connected letters and, often, ligatures.',
    long: 'The form of letters used in Greek changed from about 800 CE. The letter forms are quite distinct from the older majuscule forms. Sometimes this change is traced to the Stoudion monastery, but in fact the letter-forms derive from previous cursive usage, although the scriptorium of the Stoudion monastery may have propagated the script. It was much faster to write than the older majuscule script and the vast majority of Byzantine manuscripts are in minuscule. Minuscule manuscripts do not separate words, but do add breathings and accents, increasing legibility. The use of ligatures and abbreviations, however, counters ease of legibility. At first only the pure minuscule forms were used, but within a century, majuscule letter forms began to be used alongside the pure minuscule (modern type fonts reflect both sources). To begin with, minuscule was written on the ruled lines of parchment, but later the fashion was to have the letters "hanging" from the line. Another later development was the use of a variety of different sizes for various letters. Although manuscripts dating is not perfect, distinct fashions in minuscule script do enable some dating of otherwise undated manuscripts.',
